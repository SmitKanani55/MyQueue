# MyQueue

This repository contains a custom implementation of a **Queue** in C++, using arrays and front-rear pointer logic. Part of my series of re-implementing standard data structures to understand their internal mechanics and compare with STL.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Array-based queue implementation
- Core operations: `enqueue`, `dequeue`, `isEmpty`, `isFull`, `front`, `rear`
- Circular behavior for optimized space usage
- Clean and simple logic with STL-like naming
- Clear separation of declaration (`.h`) and definition (`.cpp`)

## 🛠️ How to Compile and Run

```bash
g++ main.cpp MyQueue.cpp -o MyQueueApp && ./MyQueueApp
